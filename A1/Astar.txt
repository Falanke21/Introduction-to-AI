1. In the worst situation, h(n) = 120% h*(n) = 1.2 h*(n). We can divide our heuristic value by 1.2, and by doing this, we guarantee that our heuristic h(n) would be less than or equal to the cost of optimal path h*(n). By doing that h(n) would be admissible, and admissibility implies optimality, so we can guarantee an optimal result.
2. False. Consider this example:
#######
#ab   #
#     #
#A *cd#
#     #
#e   f#
#######
At this state, the xanadu A has manhattan distance of 2, but it only needs 1 step in order to reach the goal state. h(n) > h*(n), therefore sum of manhattan distance is not an admissible heuristic function.
