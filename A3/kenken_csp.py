All models need to return a CSP object, and a list of lists of Variable objects 
representing the board. The returned list of lists is used to access the 
solution. 

For example, after these three lines of code

    csp, var_array = kenken_csp_model(board)
    solver = BT(csp)
    solver.bt_search(prop_FC, var_ord)

var_array[0][0].get_assigned_value() should be the correct value in the top left
cell of the KenKen puzzle.

The grid-only models do not need to encode the cage constraints.

1. binary_ne_grid (worth 10/100 marks)
    - A model of a KenKen grid (without cage constraints) built using only 
      binary not-equal constraints for both the row and column constraints.

2. nary_ad_grid (worth 10/100 marks)
    - A model of a KenKen grid (without cage constraints) built using only n-ary 
      all-different constraints for both the row and column constraints. 

3. kenken_csp_model (worth 20/100 marks) 
    - A model built using your choice of (1) binary binary not-equal, or (2) 
      n-ary all-different constraints for the grid.
    - Together with KenKen cage constraints.
